Another project in Wes Bos' awesome JS30 project.  Uses the Fetch API to get json data for city population and display as you type.

Added a few extras: debounce on type, notification system on load and clear

TODO: animate in each item?  performance implications?  also: find good Wikipedia API to link each city by name (click city, get their page?)
