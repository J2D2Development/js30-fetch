Another project in Wes Bos' awesome JS30 series.  Uses the Fetch API to get json data for city population and display as you type.

Added a few extras: debounce on type, notification system on load and clear.  This is not a perfect application!  The animations are less than stellar, my near color-blindness led to some poor choices, and some of the wikipedia link edge cases need handline.  It was, however, fun to build.
