Use the Fetch API to get json data for city population and display as you type.

Added a few extras: debounce on type, notification system on load and clear.  This is not a perfect application!  The animations need refining and optimization, could use a better design, and some of the wikipedia link edge cases need handline.  It was, however, fun to build.
